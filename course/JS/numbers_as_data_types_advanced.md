# JS | Numbers as Data Types - Advanced Topics  
## Writing big numbers  
In JS it is possible to write big numbers by adding the letter *e* to the number and specifying how many zeros there are in the number:  
> 1e6  
> > 1000000  
  
At the same time, this is not just applicable to the large numbers, but for the very small ones as well:  
> const someSmallNumber = 1e-3  
> > 0.001

## Number Methods for Rounding  
JS has several built-in functions for rounding:  
* **Math.floor()** => rounds down  
* **Math.ceil()** => rounds up  
* **.toFixed(n)** => returns a string representation of n decimal places  
* **.Number()**  
* **plus (+) sign**

## Not accurate calculation  
* Infinity  
* Off calculations

## Other math methods on numbers  
* **Math.random()**  
* **Math.max(a,b,c,...)/Math.min(a,b,c,...)**  
* **Math.pow(n,power)**

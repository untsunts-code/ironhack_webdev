#### Introduction
  
##### Terminal Emulators
Terminal emulators (terminal application or only term) provide text-based access to the operating system (no graphical nature).  
Terminal emulators provide a command-line interface to the operating system. It is used in conjunction with a __*Unix shell*__ such as __bash__ or __ZSH__.  

##### Command line
The command-line is a handy tool included in your __Operating System__. It provides a vast number of functionalities for interacting with your computer.
    
*Command Line Interface (CLI)* is a terminal program that provides an interface that allows us to type text commands to our computer.  
More straightforward explanations would be - CLI is a tool in which you can type text commands to perform specific tasks.  

When using your computer, you commonly point and click on graphic elements with the mouse to perform tasks. When you do that, you are using a __GUI (Graphical User Interface)__.   

You might ask now - why would I type commands it I can use a pointer and tell my computer what to do? - Well, believe it or not, it can be much faster to complete some tasks using CLI than with GUIs and menus. Another benefit is allowing access to many more commands and scripts.  

Each OS (Mac, Windows, Unix/Linux) has a particular terminal program already included in itself:
  
* Windows includes the program __"cmd.exe"__, which is a CLI that can be used to run *DOS commands*.
* Mac OS X includes a program called __"Terminal"__, which is used to run commands within the Mac OS.
* Unix typically includes a program called __"xterm"__, which can run *BASH* or other Unix *shells*.

__*Shell*__ is a program that processes commands and returns the output.     
A terminal emulator / terminal is a program that opens a window and lets you interact with the shell.   
Terminal provides a CLI to the operating system. 

##### Opening a terminal
  
To get started with the command line, you'll need to open the terminal window.
Here are some commands that we'll be using to start our terminal journey:

* whoami  // this command will return your login name
* pwd     // this command will return the path to the current folder you are working on 
* ls      // this command will list all the files and folders in the current directory

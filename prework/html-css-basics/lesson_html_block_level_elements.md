## Block vs. Inline elements  
We already know that **within the < body > element, we writ all the elements we want to display on our website**, 
but before we move forward, it is important to mention that there are overall two different groups of tags / HTML elements:  
1. **block** level elements  
2. **inline** level elements  
*[This article](https://codeburst.io/block-level-and-inline-elements-the-difference-between-div-and-span-2f8502c1f95b) is a good reference to understand their difference*.  
  
> A [block level element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements) **begins a new line on the webpage** and, if no width is set, **extends the full width of the available horizontal space of its parent element**.  
> [Inline elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Inline_elements) flow like text. They **don't start a new line** and only **take up as much width as neecessary**.

## How to use block level elements  
### The < header > tag  
> According to the official MDN docs, < header > elements represent an introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. 
It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.  
  
The < header > element is used to identify content that  precedes the primary content of the web page and often contains website branding, 
navigation elements, search forms, and similar content that is duplicated across all or more pages of a website.  
  
### The < div > tag  
> < div > : [The Content Division element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div) is one of the most generic and most used elements when you start planning and building your page. 
Think of them as **boxes that will group parts of your webpage that are supposed to go together**. It is commonly used to separate parts of a web page or wrap content for styling.  
  
*If a div has no content inside, its height will be zero by default.*

## What is a Markup Language  
[Markup languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) are languages designed for the processsing, definition, and presentation of text.
In simple English, we could say, **markup languages are used to present somee information to the users in a specific format -
 using different layouts and styles**. The elements used to specify the format are called *tags*.  
 In short,  you define elements as tags, and those tags are formatted into a fancy new document.

## What is HTML?  
> According to the *MDN - Mozilla Developer Network* (you will know much more about MDN as you progress through the course since it contains all the official docs we will be refering to),
[HTML - HyperText Markup Language](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the most fundamental building block of the Web. 
It defines the meaning and structure of web content. 
It uses *tags* as its main building blocks to create web pages.  
  
  
We mentioned tags several times up to this point, so let's cover this concept next.  
  
### Tags and Attributes  
#### Tags  
A **web page** is a collection of different *types* of content. Some of the basic **types of content** that almost any webpage has are:
**text, images, video** and **audio**. All different types of content are **represented by corresponding HTML tags and rendered in browsers**.  
> We can make the following conclusion: **an HTML document is a collection of tags.**
Tags are used to describe specific types of content such as images, paragraphs, headings, footers and many more.  
> **Tags usually come in pairs: an opening tag defines the start of a block of content, and an ending tag defines the end of that block of content.**

## Introduction  
In the last couple of years, a variety of frontend code-playgrounds have appeared.
Their main goal is to offer a quick and easy way to experiment with client-side (frontend) code and be able to share it with others.

## CodePen  
### What is CodePen?  

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) is the website you can use to write frontend code. 
This means next - since we are talking about the frontend, you can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and see instantly the results of your work with no need to switch to another tab 
(where the page is open) or to refresh the page, so it pick up the updates. Everything happens instantly within the same browser tab.  
  
### Can't I use VS Code and my browser to build frontend part(s) of my web apps?  
  
Yes, you can, but **CodePen will save you a lot of time** and here is why:   
* No need to change the screens (from VS Code to your browser and vice versa)  
* No need to refresh the page to be able to see the changes  
* Setting up a good and adequate environment takes much more than a couple of seconds (so instead of spending time on choosing and setting up the env on your machine, you can get some work done)  
  
So, this all being said, we encourage you to make heavy use of CodePen.  
  
### How CodePen works  
> You don't need to have an account to use CodePen, however, during this module, you will be submitting exercises through the CodePen to your TAs.
They will take a look at them and give you feedback. This means they need to know with whom they are communicating, so you will have to create an account on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/).  
  
1. How to create an account on CodePen?  
It is as simple as following the [Sign up link](https://codepen.io/accounts/signup/user/free) and choosing one of the options.  
2. How can I create my own project?  
Although on the left side, you can see the tab *Project*, we really won't use it since it is meant to be used for more complex things, 
for which we need to use some frontend frameworks. What you will be using are posts which are called **pens** in CodePen.  
3. On the left side of the pens, there are three mini windows (*HTML, CSS, JS*). The *right side* is where you will be able to see the results of your work - it simulates the browser window.

#### Introduction  
To get more familiar with this subject, start by watching this short *video* - [What is Git and Github](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUuTYDg9XoI).

#### What is a Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)  
A *Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) or Version Control System (VCS)* is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so you can recall specific versions of these files at any point later.  
These systems allow you to have different versions of each file that compose your project so that you can recover an old version, in case you break some of your code (something very common).  
The DVCS usually works together with a *Code Hosting Platform*, where your team can store the project's code and make it available to share it among members of the team.  
In computer programming, *the combination of DVCS with a Code Hosting Platform helps you to work with your team. This is the most powerfull tool you will use to combine code created by different team members.*  
When two different team members are working on the same file, the VCS is going to help them combine their code, and pick which code to accept if both developers edit the same code.  
  
##### Why is it so important to use DVCS in development?  
* *Having different verions of the same file gives you massive power over your code.* As said before, if you break something in the latest version of the code, you will be able to recover the old correct version of your code.  
* It is also beneficial when you *combine code made by multiple developers into one file*, or even different files into one project.
When merging the changes made on the same file but by different developers, you can face multiple conflicts between these changes.  
* Another cool feature that it provides you is the chance to see *who is the owners of each piece of code*. It allows you to defend how many hours you've been working, of course, but it is **funnier** to use it to figure out who has messed up the code.

#### What is Git?  
*[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a free and open DVCS* designed to handle computer programming projects with speed and efficiency.
It is easy to learn and has a very high performance.  
  
> *Git runs locally*. It allows you to use the VCS on your laptop. It means that you will have *in your computer* a VCS, to recover all code, see what changes you've made, etc.

#### What is Github?  
*[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform* for revision *control and collaboration*. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.  
With GitHub, you can do a bunch of things when collaborating on a project:  
* control different versions of your code  
* create different branches  
* fork repositories  
* do pull requests  
* see other's people projects (and learn how they code)  
* comment on other's people code

#### How are Git and GitHub related?  
> *Git* allow you to control your code in your **local machine**, while *GitHub* will enable you to *collaborate* with your teammates by **pushing and pulling** the code you and the others have been working on.  
  
#### How does it work?  
* **push** meaning making the code that was made locally, on your laptop, available online (on GitHub) so that others can use it  
* **pull** meaning taking the code from online platform (GitHub) to your laptop so you can re-use it and add/remove things from it
